# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Week 3 challenge is to rebuild last week's webpage but with bootstrap components.

# Description
I want to use bootstrap to speed up my design process. I want to create a portfolio of my deployed webpages to improve my employability. Setting up the portfolio now will help me realize my progress and is a valuable tool to share my findings with fellow students.

## CSS
I want to use CSS to make changes to my bootstrap skeleton. Use !important override to prioritize personal design and functionality changes.

## HTML
Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
Heading attributes fall in sequential order
Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
